	  The ACR docker credential helper is an alternative to the
	  existing file store based ACR helper [...] which relies
	  on az command line and is not optimised for use in CI
	  environments. Primary use case for this helper is for use
	  with kaniko and other tools running in CI scenarios wishing
	  to push to Azure Container Registry.
