	  passt: Plug A Simple Socket Transport
	  pasta: Pack A Subtle Tap Abstraction

	  passt implements a translation layer between a Layer-2
	  network interface and native Layer-4 sockets (TCP, UDP,
	  ICMP/ICMPv6 echo) on a host. It doesn't require any
	  capabilities or privileges, and it can be used as a simple
	  replacement for Slirp.

	  pasta (same binary as passt, different command) offers
	  equivalent functionality, for network namespaces: traffic
	  is forwarded using a tap interface inside the namespace,
	  without the need to create further interfaces on the host,
	  hence not requiring any capabilities or privileges.
