	  OATH Toolkit provide components to build one-time password
	  authentication systems. It contains shared C libraries,
	  command line tools and a PAM module. Supported technologies
	  include the event-based HOTP algorithm (RFC 4226), the
	  time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC 6238), and Portable Symmetric
	  Key Container (PSKC, RFC 6030) to manage secret key
	  data. OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the
	  organization that specify the algorithms.
