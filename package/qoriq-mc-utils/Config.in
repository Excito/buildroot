	  The Management Complex (MC) is a key component of the
	  networking subsystem named DPAA2 (Data Path Acceleration
	  Architecture, second version) in some NXP Layerscape SoCs.

	  The MC firmware is configured through two distinct files
	  named DPL and DPC, which are customizable by the end user.
	  Example configuration files for NXP reference boards are
	  distributed through this package, and are frequently patched
	  to produce the configuration required in other scenarios.

	string "Data Path Configuration (DPC) custom file paths"
	help
	  The DPC file contains the settings defining the behavior
	  of the MC firmware. Its structure follows the device
	  tree syntax and is compiled to a device tree blob.

	  This option defines a space-separated list of device
	  tree source (DTS) file names, specified without
	  the trailing .dts. It should be used when the NXP
	  qoriq-mc-utils repository does not contain an adequate
	  DPC for the platform, and is preferable to patching
	  the package.

config BR2_PACKAGE_QORIQ_MC_UTILS_DPC_INTREE
	string "Data Path Configuration (DPC) in-tree files"
	help
	  This option defines a space-separated list of device
	  tree source (DTS) files relative to the "config/"
	  folder of the qoriq-mc-utils repository, specified
	  without the trailing .dts. It should be used when NXP
	  provides an adequate DPC for the platform.

config BR2_PACKAGE_QORIQ_MC_UTILS_DPL_CUSTOM_PATH
	string "Data Path Layout (DPL) custom file paths"
	help
	  The DPL file contains a description of the initial
	  networking objects created by the MC firmware when it
	  boots. Its structure follows the device tree syntax
	  and is compiled to a device tree blob.

	  This option defines a space-separated list of device
	  tree source (DTS) files, specified without the
	  trailing .dts. It should be used when the NXP
	  qoriq-mc-utils repository does not contain an
	  adequate DPL for the platform, and is preferable to
	  patching the package.

config BR2_PACKAGE_QORIQ_MC_UTILS_DPL_INTREE

	string "Path on target to install DPL and DPC files"
	help
	  The DPL and DPC files can optionally be deployed to
	  the target at the path specified here. This is useful
	  if the mcinitcmd U-Boot environment variable is
	  configured to apply the DPL and DPC from the filesystem.
