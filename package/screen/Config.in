	  Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a
	  physical terminal between several processes, typically
	  interactive shells.  Each virtual terminal provides the
	  functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition,
	  several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and
	  ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support for
	  multiple character sets).
