	  bmap-writer is a command-line utility designed to
	  efficiently write disk images to storage devices using block
	  mapping (BMAP). It serves as a lightweight alternative to
	  the Yocto BMAP tool, specifically for embedded
	  systems. Unlike the Yocto BMAP tool, bmap-writer is C++
	  based, does not require Python, and focuses solely on
	  writing an image.
