	  The USB-over-IP suite of tools.

	  Note: you'll have to enable either (or both) of "VHCI hcd"
	  (CONFIG_USBIP_VHCI_HCD) if you want to access a remote USB
	  device, or "Host driver" (CONFIG_USBIP_HOST) if you want
	  to share a USB device, in your kernel configuration. The
	  Buildroot package "hwdata" with the "usb.ids" file is also
	  useful (but not mandatory) to list and identify USB device
	  by name.
