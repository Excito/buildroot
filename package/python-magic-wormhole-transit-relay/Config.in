	  Transit Relay server for Magic-Wormhole.

	  This repository implements the Magic-Wormhole "Transit
	  Relay", a server that helps clients establish bulk-data
	  transit connections even when both are behind NAT
	  boxes. Each side makes a TCP connection to this server and
	  presents a handshake. Two connections with identical
	  handshakes are glued together, allowing them to pretend they
	  have a direct connection.
