	  Build and install firmware files for the panel-mipi-dbi DRM
	  driver. The driver requires firmware file(s) to provide
	  initialization commands for the specific display(s) in
	  use. The initialization commands are written in text form
	  and converted to the binary format during the build.

	  If you select this package you will be prompted for the
	  initialization command file(s) to build firmware from.

	  file must match the first element of the "compatible" device
	  tree property of the display the file is for.
