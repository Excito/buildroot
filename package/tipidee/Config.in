	  tipidee is a web server. It supports HTTP 1.0 and 1.1. It aims
	  to be compliant with RFC 9112: while it only implements a very
	  limited subset of the optional functionality in HTTP 1.1, it
	  implements all the mandatory parts. It is usable with both
	  HTTP and HTTPS.

	  It runs under a super-server, e.g. inetd, s6-tcpserver, or
	  s6-tlsserver (for HTTPS). Traditionally, inetd-mode web
	  servers aren't considered performant, but tipidee aims to eke
	  out every single drop of performance that is attainable with
	  its programming model.
